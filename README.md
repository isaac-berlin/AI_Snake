### About Our Study

This codebase is part of an in-depth research study examining deterministic and non-deterministic approaches for training automated agents in playing the Snake game. Specifically, our study compares the performance of the A* algorithm with a deep-q neural network.

### Detailed Research Findings

For detailed insights, analysis, and comprehensive results, explore the [full research paper](Results/Results.pdf) available in the "[Results](/Results)" folder of this repository. The research paper provides extensive details on our experimental methodologies, findings, and conclusions drawn from the comparison between the A* algorithm and the deep-q neural network in playing the Snake game.
